# How to run the custom version of PySmell

First of all, add in the folder "dataset" the dataset to analyze. This version of PySmell assumes that the initial dataset is NICHE authored by "Ratnadira Widyasari, Zhou Yang, Ferdian Thung, Sheng Qin Sim, Fiona Wee, Camellia Lok, Jack Phan, Haodi Qi, Constance Tan, Qijin Tay, and David Lo" (NICHE: A Curated Dataset of Engineered Machine Learning Projects in Python)
Published at MSR Conference 2023.

Then create a folder, namely "projects" with two sub-dirs "not_well_engineered_projects" and "well_engineered_projects" then run the file "pysmell/detection/metric_explore.py"
N.B. This custom version of PySmell was tested only with the NICHE Dataset.
